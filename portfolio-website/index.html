            <p class="description">Soccer, a Jack Russell terrier, was the star of the PBS tv series Wishbone (1995). Of course since I'm only 3 I never got to see the show actually ON PBS but my owner lets me watch the re-runs sometimes. He was one of over one hundred dogs that auditioned for the role, and was picked for being the most expressive. <i>(Also the cutest in my not so humble opinion)</i></p>

                <p>We shall say 'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us. Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system! Now, look here, my good man. It's only a model.
                    Well, she turned me into a newt. I have to push the pram a lot. It's only a model. On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place. Oh, ow! On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place.
                    The nose? What do you mean? How do you know she is a witch? And the hat. She's a witch! What a strange person. I have to push the pram a lot.
                    We want a shrubbery!! I dunno. Must be a king. Why do you think that she is a witch? Well, I got better. But you are dressed as one… And this isn't my nose. This is a false one.
                    Oh, ow! Well, she turned me into a newt. Camelot! How do you know she is a witch? What do you mean? I am your king.
                    Burn her anyway! The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land. He hasn't got shit all over him. He hasn't got shit all over him.
