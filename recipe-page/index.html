                <h2>Preparation</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Season beef with 2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Set aside for at least 30 minutes at room temperature, or chill in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours.</li>
                    <li>In a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot with a tightfitting lid, cook bacon over medium-low heat until fat is rendered and bacon is browned and crisp, about 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer with a slotted spoon to a paper towel-lined plate. Reserve fat in pot.</li>
                    <li>Heat oven to 350 degrees fahrenheight. Raise heat under pot to medium-high and cook until fat starts to smoke. Lay half the beef cubes in a single layer in the pot, leaving space between pieces. Cook until well browned on all sides, 10 to 15 minutes; transfer pieces to a plate as they brown. Repeat with remaining beef.</li>
                    <li>Reduce heat. Stir in onion, carrot and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and cook until soft, about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
                    <li>Stir in garlic and tomato paste, and cook for 1 minute.</li>
                    <li>Stir in flour, cook for 1 minute, then add wine, bay leaf and thyme, scraping up brown bits at bottom of pot.</li>
                    <li>Add browned beef and half the cooked bacon to pot, cover, and transfer to oven. Let cook until beef is very tender, about 1 1/2 hours, turning meat halfway through.</li>
                    <li>While the pot is in the oven, in a large skillet set over high heat, combine pearl onions, mushrooms, 1/4 cup water, olive oil and a pinch each of salt, pepper and sugar. Bring to a simmer, then cover and reduce heat to medium, cooking for 15 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Uncover, raise heat to high, and cook, tossing frequently, until vegetables are well browned, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
                    <li>To serve, scatter onions and mushrooms and remaining cooked bacon over stew.</li>
                </ol>
